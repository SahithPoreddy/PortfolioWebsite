    The primary focus of a frontend developer lies in making a
    beautifully crafted web pages which is both user friendly and
    responsive across all devices. I've learned many things not by
    attending lectures but by doing real world projects. I've made some
    responsive websites to become better at web development. To add, the
    website your currently viewing is a project itself. Various tech
    stacks have been used over the course of making these websites
    starting from basic building blocks like Vanilla CSS and JavaScript
    to modern frameworks like tailwind CSS and React JS Library.
