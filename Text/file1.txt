The primary focus of a frontend developer lies in making a beautifully crafted web pages which is both user friendly and responsive across all devices. I've learned many things not by attending lectures but by doing real world projects. I've made some responsive websites to become better at web development. To add, the website your currently viewing is a project itself. Various tech stacks have been used over the course of making these websites starting from basic building blocks like Vanilla CSS and JavaScript to modern frameworks like tailwind CSS and React JS Library.
