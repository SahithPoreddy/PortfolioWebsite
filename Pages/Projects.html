          <span style="font-weight: bold">IEEE Landing Page Development</span>
          <br /><br />
          As part of my summer internship at Geethanjali College of Engineering
          and Technology, I had the opportunity to design and develop an
          engaging and responsive IEEE landing page. Utilizing my skills in
          JavaScript, Bootstrap, and HTML, I created a dynamic and visually
          appealing web page tailored to meet the needs of the IEEE community.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Key Features</span>: <br />
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">Responsive Design</span>:
          Leveraged Bootstrap's powerful grid system to ensure the landing page
          is fully responsive across various devices, providing an optimal
          viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. <br />
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">Interactive Elements</span>:
          Incorporated JavaScript to enhance user interaction with dynamic
          content, smooth animations, and seamless transitions. Modern UI/UX:
          Focused on delivering a clean and modern user interface, aligned with
          IEEE's branding guidelines, to create an intuitive and engaging user
          experience. <br />
          <span style="text-decoration: underline"
            >Cross-Browser Compatibility</span
          >: Ensured consistent functionality and appearance across multiple web
          browsers, providing a reliable user experience for all visitors.
          <br />
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">Accessibility</span>:
          Implemented accessibility best practices to make the landing page
          usable for individuals with disabilities, following WCAG guidelines.
          <br />
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">Technologies Used</span>:
          <br />
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">JavaScript</span>: Enabled
          dynamic content and enhanced user interactions.
          <br />
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">Bootstrap</span>: Provided a
          responsive layout and streamlined the design process with pre-styled
          components. <br />
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">HTML</span>: Structured the
          content effectively, adhering to semantic HTML5 standards. This
          project not only enhanced my technical skills but also gave me
          valuable experience in web development, user interface design, and
          collaborative work in a professional environment. The IEEE landing
          page is now a pivotal part of my portfolio, showcasing my ability to
          create functional and aesthetically pleasing web applications.

        <div class="projectDescription">
          As part of my minor project in the junior year of my college
          education, me along with a team of enthusiastic web developers and a
          senior had focussed on solving a major issue prevailing in the college
          i.e. a full stack application to digitalize the application process of
          registrations like supplementary exams, written tests and
          re-evaluation.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Key Features</span>: <br />
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">Responsive Design</span>:
          Made sure that the application is accessed on any device by making it
          responsive. Material UI and tailwind CSS are used to achieve this.
          <br />
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">Student info</span>: Once
          place to access every information related to a student. Things like
          the subjects the students have registered for, student roll number,
          year, number of backlogs are present.<br />
          <span style="text-decoration: underline"
            >Cross-Browser Compatibility</span
          >: Ensured consistent functionality and appearance across multiple web
          browsers, providing a reliable user experience for all visitors.
          <br />
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">Download and Upload</span>:
          Existing information can be downloaded from the web application for
          data analysis or new information can be uploaded to update the
          existing data.
          <br />
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">Data modification</span>:
          Data related to the deadlines for the exams registrations, fines, fees
          etc can be updated without any hassle
          <br />
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">Technologies Used</span>:
          <br />
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">Typescript + React JS</span>:
          Enabled to develop frontend components with a strongly typed frontend
          scripting language.
          <br />
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">Express JS</span>: Used as
          the backend framework, built on top of Node JS. <br />
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">MySQL</span>: Relational
          database used to store the data in the form of tables. Since most of
          the data used forms a table, it made sense to use this database. It is
          found to be relatively simple to implement and use.
