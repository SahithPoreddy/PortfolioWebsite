        Hackathons and Events

        <h2 class="sideHeadings">Robotica - 2024:</h2>
        <div>
          Soon after I was appointed as the Vice-President of our institute's
          Robotics club, took the initiate of organising an yearly event which
          goes and becomes a tradition within the college. It was the time for
          the club to raise it's standard in terms of happening. It was a
          two-day event on 1st and 2nd of March, 2024. It included four
          events:<br />
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>1. Ideathon</li>
            <li>2. Skydash</li>
            <li>3. Goal rush</li>
            <li>4. Full throttle</li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          It was first time such an event was conducted. The prepartion started
          well before 40 days from the date of the event. Many aspects like
          marketing, sponsorships, logistics, finances, arena prepartion, jury
          were taken care by our team of 25 people. <br />
          <h3>First day:</h3>
          The first day was all about ideathon. Participants were given 17
          Sustainable Development Goals out of which one topic is to be chosen
          and work on the same. Well over 100 people showed up not just from
          within the college but also from various institutions within the
          state. It began with a resource person explaining the importance of
          SDG goals and why it is important. Certain parameter where chosen upon
          which the judgement criteria was designed.<br />
          <h3>Second day:</h3>
          Second day of the event was the combination of ideathon presentations
          as well as the other three technical events happening simulataneously.
          Many students from other students also showed up and expressed their
          interest in our event. The total cash prize of 80,000 Rupees attracted
          a huge mass and made it a grand success. Students of freshman year
          felt inspired and learnt new lessons from the same. With well over 250
          participants, it did bring a lot of enthusiasm.

        <h2 class="sideHeadings">3D Printing Workshop - 2023:</h2>
        <p>
          As part of the Robotics club of our institution, we have organised a
          workshop to enhance our members understanding in 3D printing on 3rd
          August, 2023. Many curious students signed up and expressed their
          interest in the field of electronics. It was a one-day event which
          included the CAD software followed by live demo of working of a 3D
          printer. It was a fun and enriching experience for the resource
          persons, organisers and students alike.These events provide much
          insightful time rather than regular theory sessions. It was a great
          success thanks to the team of Robotics Club of Geethanjali College of
          Engineering and Technology.

        <h2 class="sideHeadings">Elecsta Ideathon - 2023:</h2>
        <p>
          Malla Reddy Engineering College (MREC) organised an event 'Elecsta
          Ideathon' on 23rd and 24th of July, 2024. The task was to come up with
          an idea to develop a technology or tool in one of the many available
          domains. The time duration given to come up with the respective idea
          was around 24 hours. The topic given to my team is disaster
          management. Me along with my team brain stormed many ideas but later
          found that most of them are already in use and does barely require any
          improvement. So, an idea of developing an ML model to study weather
          patterns and draw necessary insights was proposed. Even though it is
          hard to implement, the idea of making use of AI & ML was appreciated.
          Improvements over the existing system were highlighted which resulted
          in us securing 2nd prize in the event. It was a great start in our
          hackthon journey and granted us enormous confidence.
