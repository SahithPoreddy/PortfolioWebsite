# About the app :

This is a portfolio website using Vanilla js. The reason I've decided to go with this is option is because I want to explore all the js
concepts involved in developing a Single Page Applications (SPA) and get in-depth understanding of how js actually works. I haven't used any CSS Framework either. It's all traditional.
